After getting the users input for the integer array. I called a seperate method to randomise the order of the values of the array and return the shuffled array.

To do this i decided to import java's utility Random so that I could generate a psuedo-random number between the the value for the size of the array and 0.

I then create a temporary integer that will have the same value as the current position in the array. Then I set the current value to equal the value of the random position. Then I set the value of the random position to equal the temporary value.
The current value is then incremented and the code repeats untill it has gone through the length of the array.

In essence this method just takes the current position value and swaps it with a random position value. It is a simple method that will shuffle the array around adequately and I think it is the easiest way to generate a random array.
